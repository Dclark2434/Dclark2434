ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dclark2434

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an aspiring system administrator and AWS cloud engineer. 

## Skills and Technologies

- Programming Languages: Python (primary focus)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Other tools and languages relevant to system administration, engineering and DevOps

## Learning Journey

As a cloud computing student at WGU, I am actively expanding my knowledge and skills. I have been learning Python primarily through Al Sweigart's books, which has provided me with a solid foundation. 
I am also acquiring AWS skills through Stephane Maarek's Udemy videos and exploring Terraform for infrastructure automation.

## Personal Projects

While I am currently in the early stages of my journey, I am excited to work on some simple Python projects inspired by "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." 
Additionally, I am planning to participate in the Cloud Resume Challenge to further enhance my skills and showcase my abilities.

I am open to connecting with like-minded individuals, discussing ideas, and collaborating on projects.
