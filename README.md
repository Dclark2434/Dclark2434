ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm @dclark2434, an aspiring system administrator and AWS cloud engineer. I'm passionate about learning and working with various technologies in the field of system administration, engineering, and DevOps.

## Skills and Technologies
Here are the key technologies that I focus on:

Programming Languages: Python
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
Containers: Docker
Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
CI/CD Workflow: GitHub Actions
Other relevant tools and languages in the realm of system administration, engineering, and DevOps.

## Learning Journey
As a cloud computing student at WGU and an IT Support Lead at a large enterprise, I'm actively expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. My primary source for learning Python has been Al Sweigart's books, which have provided me with a solid foundation. Currently, I'm also working towards my Terraform Associate certification, CompTIA Cloud+, and PCEP.

I have already obtained the following certifications:

CompTIA Net+ Sec+ A+
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
LPI Linux Essentials
ITIL Foundation

## Personal Projects
Although I'm in the early stages of my journey, I'm excited to work on some simple Python projects inspired by "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." Additionally, I'm planning to participate in the Cloud Resume Challenge to further enhance my skills and showcase my abilities.

I'm open to connecting with like-minded individuals, discussing ideas, and collaborating on projects. Feel free to reach out to me!
