Heyo, welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm Dustin. I'm interested in learning about and working with various technologies in the field of system administration, engineering, and cloud computing. 
Occasionally, I delve into making some games but mostly just to keep my programming skills sharp.

Most of my projects right now deal with AWS, Terraform and Python.

I'm open to connecting with like-minded individuals, discussing ideas, and collaborating on projects. Feel free to reach out to me!
