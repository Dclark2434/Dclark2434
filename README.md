ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm @dclark2434, an aspiring cloud engineer. I'm passionate about learning and working with various technologies in the field of system administration, engineering, and DevOps.

## Learning Journey
As a cloud computing student at WGU and an IT Support Lead at a large enterprise, I'm actively expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.

## Personal Projects
Although I'm in the early stages of my journey, I'm excited to work on some simple Python projects. Additionally, I'm planning to participate in the Cloud Resume Challenge to further enhance my skills and showcase my abilities.

I'm open to connecting with like-minded individuals, discussing ideas, and collaborating on projects. Feel free to reach out to me!
